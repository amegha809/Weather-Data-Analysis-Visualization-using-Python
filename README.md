Weather Data Analysis and Visualization

This project analyzes weather data using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib. It focuses on understanding temperature trends, rainfall patterns, humidity relationships, and temperature distribution through various visualizations.

The project includes:

Line plots to show temperature trends across days

Bar charts to compare daily rainfall

Scatter plots to analyze humidity vs temperature relationship

Histograms to display temperature distribution

Pie charts to classify rainy and non-rainy days

Subplots to combine multiple visualizations in a single dashboard

This project demonstrates how data visualization helps in interpreting weather patterns and extracting meaningful insights from raw data.
